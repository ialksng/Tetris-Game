# Python Tetris Game - Complete Web-Ready Project

This is a complete Python Tetris game that has been modified to run both locally and in web browsers.

## 🎮 Quick Start

### Run Locally:
```bash
pip install pygame
python main.py
```

### Convert to Web (Pygbag Method):
```bash
pip install pygbag --user --upgrade
cd ..  # Navigate to parent directory
pygbag python-tetris
```
Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser!

## 📁 Project Structure

- **main.py** - Main game loop (web-compatible with async/await)
- **game.py** - Core game logic and mechanics  
- **grid.py** - 20x10 game board implementation
- **blocks.py** - All 7 Tetris pieces (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z)
- **block.py** - Base block class with movement/rotation
- **position.py** - Position coordinate system
- **colors.py** - Color definitions matching classic Tetris

## 🎯 Game Features

✅ All 7 classic Tetris pieces with proper rotations
✅ Line clearing with progressive scoring (100/300/500 points)
✅ Next piece preview
✅ Collision detection and boundary checking
✅ Game over detection
✅ Smooth piece movement and controls

## 🎮 Controls

- **←/→ Arrow Keys**: Move piece left/right
- **↓ Arrow Key**: Soft drop (faster descent)
- **↑ Arrow Key**: Rotate piece clockwise
- **Any Key**: Restart after game over

## 🌐 Web Conversion Options

### Option 1: Pygbag (Recommended - Easy)
- Converts existing Python code to WebAssembly
- Minimal code changes (already done!)
- Good performance in browsers
- One command deployment

### Option 2: Manual JavaScript  
- Complete rewrite in JavaScript/HTML5 Canvas
- Best performance but more work
- Full control over web features

## 🔧 Technical Details

**Modifications for Web Compatibility:**
- Main game loop converted to async/await structure
- Added `asyncio.sleep(0)` for browser compatibility  
- Sound loading wrapped in try/catch blocks
- Removed `sys.exit()` calls

**Original Features Preserved:**
- Identical gameplay mechanics
- Same piece movement and rotation logic
- Matching visual appearance and colors
- Compatible scoring system

## 🚀 Deployment

After pygbag conversion, you'll get a `build/web` folder containing:
- index.html
- JavaScript/WebAssembly files  
- All game assets

Upload this folder to any web server or hosting platform like:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- itch.io
- Your own server

## 🎪 Play Online

The game maintains the authentic Tetris experience while being accessible through any modern web browser. No installations required for players!
